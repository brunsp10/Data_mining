# Data_mining
Coursework for data mining class.

Contains Python files for assignments and final project for a data mining course (https://utah-data-mining-spring23.github.io/)

The project worked with brain cancer gene expression data (found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brunogrisci/brain-cancer-gene-expression-cumida) containing expression data for 54,676 genes for 130 samples from 4 cancer types and 1 control group. The project attempted to use PCA to split the samples by type and identify genes that contributed the most to separating types. The next part attempted to split the samples by clustering and distance measures on the full dataset and on reduced gene sets.
